                <h2>Origins and Etymology</h2>
                <p>The term "origami" originates from the Japanese words "oru" (to fold) and "kami" (paper), precisely defining the art of transforming a simple, flat sheet of paper into intricate two- or three-dimensional figures through a series of meticulously executed folds, entirely avoiding cuts or adhesive. While deeply intertwined with Japanese culture, the practice of paper folding is believed to have older roots.</p>

                <h2>Ancient Roots: China and Early Japan</h2>
                <p>Historians generally trace the art’s beginnings to China, where paper folding, known as "Zhe Zhi," was practiced as early as the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD). It is widely accepted that Buddhist monks introduced this practice to Japan around the 6th century, coinciding with the introduction of paper-making techniques via Korea. However, some scholars propose that rudimentary forms of paper folding may have already existed within Japanese culture before the widespread adoption of paper.</p>

                <h2>Development within Japanese Culture</h2>
                <p>In early Japan, paper was a scarce and valuable resource, which initially restricted origami to specific and formal settings. It became closely associated with Shinto religious ceremonies and sacred rituals. The earliest documented religious application is the creation of "katashiro," folded paper representations of deities, utilized in rituals at the Ise Grand Shrine. Over time, origami gradually permeated various layers of Japanese society. It initially found a place in Buddhist practices, then expanded to the "bushi" (warrior) class, where folded paper flowers symbolized friendship and goodwill. At the Imperial Court, nobles traditionally presented gifts on elaborately folded sheets of paper, demonstrating respect and refined elegance.</p>

            <div class="content" id="early-written-records">
                <h2>Early Written Records</h2>
                <p>For generations, origami techniques were primarily transmitted orally. The earliest known written documentation of origami appeared in the 18th century. The "Ranma-Zushiki," published in 1734, includes the "tamatebako" (Pandora's box) model from the folk tale of Urashima Tarō. This model, which was lost and rediscovered in 1993 by historian Masao Okamura, uniquely incorporated cutting and collage, a deviation from traditional origami principles. In 1797, the publication of "Hiden senbazuru orikata" (The Secret Art of Folding a Thousand Cranes) represented the first known treatise dedicated entirely to origami. It codified folding techniques and facilitated their transmission through written instructions. This historical document signifies the increasing popularity of origami as a creative pastime in Japan.</p>

                <h2>Western Influence and Globalization</h2>
                <p>The 19th century witnessed the spread of origami beyond Japan, spurred by increasing cultural exchanges with the West. These interactions introduced new techniques and perspectives, enriching origami by incorporating European folding traditions, notably the art of “napkin folding” practiced during aristocratic banquets.<br><br>In the early 19th century, German educator Friedrich Fröbel, the founder of the kindergarten system, integrated paper folding into his educational curriculum, recognizing its value in fostering children’s development. Around 1890, the publication of the "Livre des amusettes" (Book of Amusements) popularized the term "paper amusette" for this practice in Western cultures.</p>

                <h2>Modern Origami and Its Masters</h2>
                <p>Akira Yoshizawa and the Origami Revolution<br><br>The 20th century was a transformative period for origami, largely due to the monumental contributions of Akira Yoshizawa (1911-2005). Revered as the father of modern origami, this Japanese master revolutionized the art. Born into a farming family and later working as a technical draughtsman, Yoshizawa initially employed origami to teach geometry to apprentices. In 1954, he published his seminal work, "Atarashii Origami Geijutsu" (New Origami Art), and established the International Origami Center in Tokyo. His most significant contribution was the development of a standardized system of diagrams for representing folding instructions, which greatly facilitated the global dissemination of the art. A prolific creator, Yoshizawa developed over 50,000 models, although only a fraction were published in his extensive body of work. In 1983, in recognition of his exceptional contributions to Japanese culture, Emperor Hirohito awarded Yoshizawa the Order of the Rising Sun.</p>
