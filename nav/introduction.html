                <h2>What is Origami?</h2>
                <p class="what-is-origami-text">Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, combining the words oru (折る), meaning “to fold”, and kami (紙), meaning “paper”. This art involves transforming 
                    a simple sheet of paper into a two- or three-dimensional figure by making a series of precise folds, without cutting or gluing the paper.</br></br>
                    Origami models vary in complexity, from simple shapes such as cranes or paper airplanes, to more detailed sculptures representing animals, flowers or geometric objects.</br></br>
                    Beyond its artistic aspect, origami is based on mathematical and geometric principles, exploring concepts such as symmetries, angles and proportions. It also has practical 
                    applications in various fields, such as the design of foldable structures for science and technology. For example, origami engineering is used to design deployable 
                    and adaptive structures in space, such as solar panels on satellites, as well as in the design of airbags and medical stents.</br></br>
                    In addition, researchers have used origami designs to fold DNA into specific structures, paving the way for potential applications in nanotechnology and medicine.
