                <h2>The Basic Foundations of Origami</h2>
                <p>Origami is based on a set of fundamental techniques and preliminary structures that form the backbone of this ancient art. Elementary folds and traditional bases form the essential vocabulary that all folders must master to create models, from the simplest to the most complex. Although seemingly simple, these preliminary structures are the fruit of centuries of evolution and offer remarkable versatility, enabling the creation of an infinite number of shapes from a single sheet of paper.</p>

                <h2>The Mountain Fold and the Valley Fold</h2>
                <p>The mountain fold forms a ridge where the paper folds downwards, creating a shape that looks like a mountain when viewed from the side. Conversely, the valley fold creates a groove where the paper folds upwards, forming a valley-like depression. Mastery of these two folds is essential, as they form the foundation of all more advanced techniques.</p>

                <h2>Symbols and Notations</h2>
                <p>To effectively convey folding instructions, origami uses a universal visual language of standardized symbols. This notation enables origamists the world over to understand and reproduce models without language barriers. For example, a solid arrow indicates a forward fold, while an empty arrow means a backward fold. Other symbols represent more complex actions, such as inverted inner or outer folds, which are crucial for creating elaborate shapes.

                <h2>The Four Classic Bases</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional bases are intermediate configurations that serve as a starting point for the creation of specific patterns. Although there are many of them, four are considered the pillars of traditional origami: the Kite base, the Fish base, the Bird base and the Frog base.<br>
                    These bases are remarkably similar in structure, all being built from the same triangular element. The difference between them lies mainly in the number and arrangement of these triangles. The simplest, the Kite base, has two triangular elements, while the more complex Frog base contains sixteen. This observation, highlighted by Eric Kenneway, reveals the elegant structural coherence underlying these traditional bases.

                <h2>Origami Model Transmission Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Diagrams</span><br>Diagrams are the most universal and widespread method of explaining an origami model. It consists of a series of illustrations accompanied by standardized symbols, representing step-by-step the folds to be made. This system, developed by Akira Yoshizawa in the 20th century, makes it possible to transmit complex instructions without language barriers, thanks to an internationally recognized graphic language. The diagrams are suitable for all levels, from beginner to expert, and form the basis of most origami books and publications. They make it easier to understand the folding sequences and help you to progress in a structured way.</li>
                    <li><span>Tutorials</span><br>Tutorials, whether in text, photo or video form, offer a more narrative and often more detailed approach to learning. Video tutorials, in particular, are a big hit on the Internet, as they allow you to visualize the bender's movements in real time, grasp the rhythm and observe the delicate manipulations. Photo or text tutorials, on the other hand, detail each step with additional explanations, which can help remove the ambiguities sometimes present in conventional diagrams. They are particularly useful for complex patterns, or for people who learn best by direct observation.</li>
                    <li><span>Crease Patterns (CP)</span><br>A crease pattern (CP) is a schematic representation of all (or some) of the fold lines in an origami model, usually in the form of a drawing on a square sheet of paper. Unlike the diagram, the CP does not give the sequence of folds or detailed instructions: it is therefore aimed at an informed public, capable of analyzing the structure and deducing the necessary steps from the diagram. For the designer, the CP serves as an external memory, recording the pattern's logic, symmetries and key points. For advanced enthusiasts, it's an intellectual challenge, a kind of puzzle to be solved in order to reconstitute the final figure. Certain software programs, such as TreeMaker or Oriedita, facilitate the creation and interpretation of these patterns.</li>

                <h2>Modern Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    Innovations such as wet folding, in which the paper is slightly moistened to create gentle curves and sculpted shapes, have extended the expressive possibilities of origami. This technique, developed notably by Akira Yoshizawa, gives models a more organic, almost living appearance.<br>
                    Modular origami, on the other hand, is based on the assembly of several identical units to form complex structures such as stars, polyhedra or kusudama. This type of folding emphasizes precision, symmetry and patience, offering a collective and architectural dimension to the art of folding.

                <h2>Materials</h2>
                <p>A simple square of paper is all you need to get started. Use standard origami paper (15*15 cm), which is easy to fold and inexpensive. You can also recycle scrap paper or turn an A4 sheet into a square (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp6E52Xqo3w">see a tutorial here</a>). No tools are strictly necessary, but a folding tool or ruler can help to mark folds more accurately.</p>
